**Transportation**

Melbourne offers a variety of transportation options for travelers to get around the city, with its well-developed and reliable public transportation system. The tram network covers much of the city center and outer suburbs, while the train network connects different parts of Melbourne and extends to the outer suburbs. Buses are also available, providing additional coverage to areas not serviced by trams or trains.

To make using public transportation easier, travelers should obtain a myki card for paying fares.

For planning journeys and accessing real-time updates on schedules, routes, and service disruptions, the PTV (Public Transport Victoria) website and smartphone app are valuable resources. Travelers can also seek assistance from staff at train stations and major tram stops for directions or inquiries. To avoid crowded transport, it is advised to plan activities outside of rush hour times.<br><br><br><br>
